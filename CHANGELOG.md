# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Sensing model.** A `docs/sensing-hierarchy.svg` diagram and a "Sensing
  model" section documenting why structured/text signals are preferred over
  vision (answer from the cheapest signal the device exposes; escalate to OCR
  and a vision model only as a last resort).
- Forward-looking capability protocols in `drivers/base.py`: `Logs`,
  `BootProgress`, `Sensors`, `SerialConsole`, `Watchdog`. The PiKVM client now
  reports the `Logs` capability (`/api/log`); the rest are the seam for the
  Redfish and IPMI drivers, where boot phase is a structured enum and the
  console is a serial text stream.
- `KVMClient.has_video_signal()` — a cheap "is there a screen?" probe over
  `/api/streamer`, parsed defensively (only `False` on a positive offline
  report).
- `ScreenAnalyzer` gates: `gate_on_power_signal`, `skip_unchanged_frames` (both
  default on) and opt-in `ocr_rules` (with `DEFAULT_OCR_RULES`), plus
  `vlm_calls` / `cheap_resolves` counters.
- **CLI `capabilities`** — print the capabilities the active driver supports
  (offline; no network call).
- **CLI `events`** — stream device events over the WebSocket (`--duration`,
  `--count`, `--no-stream`); requires the `ws` extra.
- **Global `--timeout`** flag (HTTP per-request timeout) plus the matching
  `KVM_PILOT_TIMEOUT` env var; `scheme` now also resolves through the full
  args > env > file precedence with a `--scheme` flag / `KVM_PILOT_SCHEME`.
- `KVMClient.from_config(cfg)` — one constructor for the field-by-field build
  the CLI, MCP server, and examples each previously repeated.
- **Driver registry.** `make_driver(kind, **conf)` (mirroring `make_backend`)
  plus `register_driver()` for third-party kinds; built-in kinds `pikvm` /
  `glkvm` / `blikvm` (the `KVMClient`) and `fake`. A `--driver` CLI flag selects
  among them.
- **`FakeDriver`** (`kvm_pilot.drivers.FakeDriver`) — an in-process,
  hardware-free driver implementing the capability protocols over scriptable
  in-memory state, with destructive ops still routed through `SafetyPolicy`. It
  is the first real implementer of a sensing protocol (`BootProgress`), so the
  capability seam and the safety layer can be exercised end-to-end with no
  hardware. `kvm-pilot capabilities --driver fake` runs fully offline.

### Changed
- `ScreenAnalyzer.classify()` now resolves from cheap signals before calling the
  vision backend: a `power_off` / `no_signal` short-circuit (no snapshot, no
  model), an unchanged-frame skip (reuse the last result), and optional
  OCR-assist for text screens. In a typical boot-watch this avoids most model
  calls; set the flags to `False` to restore unconditional classification.
- Internal simplifications (no public behaviour change): a single
  `vision.base.request_json()` helper backs both vision backends; the classifier
  system prompt interpolates `ALL_PHASES` so its token list can no longer drift
  from the parser's; `scheme`/`timeout` no longer bypass config precedence.
- `AnthropicBackend` validates its API key **lazily** (at first network use)
  rather than at construction, so analyzer paths resolved by a cheap gate (e.g.
  `power_off`) run with no key — `kvm-pilot classify --driver fake` works fully
  offline. A `make_backend` misconfiguration now raises `VisionError` (a clean
  CLI error) instead of an uncaught `ValueError` traceback.

### Removed
- Unused surface: `HTTP.delete()`, the no-op `KVMClient`/`ScreenAnalyzer`
  context managers, the `detect_state` alias, and the `ctrl_c`/`ctrl_z` HID
  shortcuts (use `send_shortcut(...)`).

## [0.1.0a1] — 2026-06-26

First public **alpha** pre-release, published to solicit hardware testing and
user feedback. **Not validated on real hardware** — see Notes.

### Added
- `KVMClient`: full PiKVM / GLKVM REST client covering auth (incl. TOTP/2FA),
  keyboard + mouse HID, snapshots/OCR, ATX power, Mass Storage Device, GPIO,
  Redfish, WebSocket events, and system info/logs/metrics.
- Safety layer (`SafetyPolicy`): `dry_run` mode and a confirmation callback
  gating an explicit, auditable set of destructive operations.
- Pluggable vision subsystem with two backends:
  - `AnthropicBackend` — resolves the newest vision-capable model at runtime
    via the Models API; no hard-coded version. Override with
    `KVM_PILOT_VISION_MODEL` or `model=`.
  - `OpenAICompatBackend` — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LM Studio, Ollama,
    vLLM, llama.cpp) for zero-cost on-prem inference.
- `ScreenAnalyzer`: backend-agnostic single-shot classification plus blocking
  `wait_for_state` / `wait_for_any_state` loops with confidence thresholds and
  bounded backoff.
- `kvm-pilot` CLI with `info`, `snapshot`, `power`, `power-cycle`, `type`,
  `key`, `mount`, `classify`, and `watch` subcommands; interactive confirmation
  by default, `--yes` and `--dry-run` flags.
- Config resolution (`resolve_host`) with args > env > TOML-profile precedence.
- HTTP transport with bounded retry/backoff on transient errors (409/503/
  network) and password/token redaction in error text.

### Notes
- **Not tested on real hardware.** Every feature is covered only by unit tests
  with mocked HTTP and vision responses; no device — including the GL-RM1PE this
  project targets — has been exercised end to end. Hardware validation and user
  feedback are the explicit goals of this alpha. Reports welcome in the issue
  tracker.
