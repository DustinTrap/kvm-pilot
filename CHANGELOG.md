# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Sensing model.** A `docs/sensing-hierarchy.svg` diagram and a "Sensing
  model" section documenting why structured/text signals are preferred over
  vision (answer from the cheapest signal the device exposes; escalate to OCR
  and a vision model only as a last resort).
- Forward-looking capability protocols in `drivers/base.py`: `Logs`,
  `BootProgress`, `Sensors`, `SerialConsole`, `Watchdog`. The PiKVM client now
  reports the `Logs` capability (`/api/log`); the rest are the seam for the
  Redfish and IPMI drivers, where boot phase is a structured enum and the
  console is a serial text stream.
- `KVMClient.has_video_signal()` — a cheap "is there a screen?" probe over
  `/api/streamer`, parsed defensively (only `False` on a positive offline
  report).
- `ScreenAnalyzer` gates: `gate_on_power_signal`, `skip_unchanged_frames` (both
  default on) and opt-in `ocr_rules` (with `DEFAULT_OCR_RULES`), plus
  `vlm_calls` / `cheap_resolves` counters.

### Changed
- `ScreenAnalyzer.classify()` now resolves from cheap signals before calling the
  vision backend: a `power_off` / `no_signal` short-circuit (no snapshot, no
  model), an unchanged-frame skip (reuse the last result), and optional
  OCR-assist for text screens. In a typical boot-watch this avoids most model
  calls; set the flags to `False` to restore unconditional classification.

## [0.1.0a1] — 2026-06-26

First public **alpha** pre-release, published to solicit hardware testing and
user feedback. **Not validated on real hardware** — see Notes.

### Added
- `KVMClient`: full PiKVM / GLKVM REST client covering auth (incl. TOTP/2FA),
  keyboard + mouse HID, snapshots/OCR, ATX power, Mass Storage Device, GPIO,
  Redfish, WebSocket events, and system info/logs/metrics.
- Safety layer (`SafetyPolicy`): `dry_run` mode and a confirmation callback
  gating an explicit, auditable set of destructive operations.
- Pluggable vision subsystem with two backends:
  - `AnthropicBackend` — resolves the newest vision-capable model at runtime
    via the Models API; no hard-coded version. Override with
    `KVM_PILOT_VISION_MODEL` or `model=`.
  - `OpenAICompatBackend` — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LM Studio, Ollama,
    vLLM, llama.cpp) for zero-cost on-prem inference.
- `ScreenAnalyzer`: backend-agnostic single-shot classification plus blocking
  `wait_for_state` / `wait_for_any_state` loops with confidence thresholds and
  bounded backoff.
- `kvm-pilot` CLI with `info`, `snapshot`, `power`, `power-cycle`, `type`,
  `key`, `mount`, `classify`, and `watch` subcommands; interactive confirmation
  by default, `--yes` and `--dry-run` flags.
- Config resolution (`resolve_host`) with args > env > TOML-profile precedence.
- HTTP transport with bounded retry/backoff on transient errors (409/503/
  network) and password/token redaction in error text.

### Notes
- **Not tested on real hardware.** Every feature is covered only by unit tests
  with mocked HTTP and vision responses; no device — including the GL-RM1PE this
  project targets — has been exercised end to end. Hardware validation and user
  feedback are the explicit goals of this alpha. Reports welcome in the issue
  tracker.
